# Prompts Repository

This repository has been forked in-tree. The original content is preserved in `v1`, and `v2` is diverging from there.

## Structure

- `v1/` - Original repository (baseline)
- `v2/` - Fork diverging from v1
- `.git/` - Git repository history

## Note

This is an in-tree fork - both versions are maintained within the same repository tree structure. The root directory represents the current working state, which may diverge from both v1 and v2.
