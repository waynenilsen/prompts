# Tech Debt Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A minimal PRD template for technical debt reduction cycles.

---

## When to Use This Template

**Use this template when the next PRD number ends in 5 or 0** (e.g., `0005`, `0010`, `0015`, `0020`).

Every 5th PRD cycle is dedicated to paying down technical debt rather than adding new features.

**That's it.** The tech debt PRD is intentionally minimal. All technical details belong in the ERD.
